### Project Title
The Impact of Crime Hot-Spots on House Prices

### Abstract
Previous research suggests that crime negatively impacts property prices overall, but that crime hot-spots have a more significant impact than specific crime incidents. Using data from the boroughs of New York City (NYC), this project aims to identify and map crime hot-spots and examine their impact on house prices within the boroughs of NYC. By examining the geographic concentration of arrests affected by the New York City Police Department between the years of 2006 and 2020 hot-spots were identified at different geographic scales. A linear regression model with a sliding time window was used to assess the impact of crime hot-spots on property prices in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Staten Island. Evidence was found to support previous findings: that crime hot-spots have a significant effect on house prices. However the magnitude of this effect is not constant and is effected by citywide crime trends as well as other external factors. This study was severely limited by data constraints that highlight the necessity for a diverse range of descriptive attributes in the development of hedonic regression models.
